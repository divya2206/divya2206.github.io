I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am a member of [Lauder Lab](https://sites.harvard.edu/glauder/) which is led by Prof. [George V. Lauder](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/george-v-lauder). I am pursuing research in animal locomotion and bio-inspired robotics. I have experience in systematic study of animal and robot locomotion, developing tools and methods, building robots and sensors, and reinforcement learning techniques.
