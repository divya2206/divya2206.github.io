I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am a member of [Lauder Lab](https://sites.harvard.edu/glauder/) which is led by Prof. [George V. Lauder](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/george-v-lauder). 

My research focuses on understanding animal locomotion and bio-inspired robotics. I have experience in systematic study of animal and robot locomotion, developing tools and methods, building robots and sensors, and reinforcement learning techniques.

## Education & Research

I pursued my Ph.D. degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.jhu.edu/) from 2019 to 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Li](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/chen-li/) at [Terradynamics Lab](https://li.me.jhu.edu/) from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) (JHU). My research focused on studying and understanding animal and robot locomotion on 3-D complex terrain and wet flowable substrates. During my doctoral degree program, I also received my MSE degree in Robotics in 2024 from the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/). 

Prior to this, I pursued my MSE degree in Electrical Engineering from the Department of [Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) (UPenn) between 2017 and 2019. During this time, I worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant in [Kod*Lab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/) under Prof. [Daniel E. Koditschek](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/kod/). At the lab, I investigated the behavior and dynamics of legged robot during obstacle interaction. I received my B.Tech degree in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering-for-ug-courses) from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/), Vellore, India in 2017.     

## Publications, Awards & Honors

My work has been published in [IEEE RA-L](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (presented at ICRA 2020) and presented at [ICRA 2022](https://www.ieee-ras.org/component/rseventspro/event/2095-icra-2022). 2 journal preprints are currently under development from my Ph.D. research. 11 conference abstracts were presented at conferences including [APS](https://www.aps.org/membership/join) and [SICB](https://sicb.org/). 

I have been shortlisted (**8** finalists out of **210** talks selected) for the [Best Student Paper finalist (Division of Comparative Biomechanics)](https://sicb.burkclients.com/wp/?page_id=2124) at the SICB Annual Meeting in 2023. I have also received a Mechanical Engineering Departmental Fellowship for the first year of my Ph.D.

## Mentorship & Service

As part of my academic development, I have had the opportunity to mentor and teach students, take leadership roles, and participate in professional, volunteer, and outreach services. I have mentored a total of 32 students at Terradynamics Lab (**31 students**) and Kod*Lab (**1 student**) including **1 PhD** student, **14 masterâ€™s** students, **10 undergraduate** students, and **7 high school** students in animal studies, bioinspired robot design and prototyping, and tools and methods development. I was also a teaching assistant for 2 courses during my Ph.D. at JHU and 1 course during my Master's at UPenn. 

I have served as Social Chair for the [LCSR Graduate Student Association](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/lcsr-gsa/) during my Ph.D. and as Student Head for the [IEEE Power and Energy Society VIT Student Chapter](https://stage.vit.ac.in/campus/Chapters/IEEEChapters) during my undergraduate studies. I have taken other roles in committees, panels, and chapters during my Ph.D and undergraduate studies. 

## Selected Coursework

I have taken courses in various topics during my academic studies. Here is a list of selected coursework from my Ph.D. at JHU and Master's at Upenn:

**Robotics and AI:** Nonlinear control and planning in robotics, Foundations of reinforcement learning, Learning in robotics, Machine
learning

**Dynamics, Control, and Signal Processing:** Locomotion dynamics & control, Intro. to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, Dynamics of
robots and spacecraft, Control systems for robotics, System identification, Linear systems theory, Digital signal processing

**Electronics:** Analog integrated circuits, Mixed signal design and model
