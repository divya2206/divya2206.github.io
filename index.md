I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. I am a member of Lauder Lab which is led by Prof. George V. Lauder. I am pursuing research in animal locomotion and bio-inspired robotics. I have experience in systematic study of animal and robot locomotion, developing tools and methods, building robots and sensors, and reinforcement learning techniques.
