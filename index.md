I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am a member of [Lauder Lab](https://sites.harvard.edu/glauder/) which is led by Prof. [George V. Lauder](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/george-v-lauder). 

My research focuses in animal locomotion and bio-inspired robotics. I have experience in systematic study of animal and robot locomotion, developing tools and methods, building robots and sensors, and reinforcement learning techniques.

I pursued my Ph.D. degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.jhu.edu/) from 2019 to 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Li](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/chen-li/) at [Terradynamics Lab](https://li.me.jhu.edu/) from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research focused on studying and understanding animal and robot locomotion on 3-D complex terrain and wet flowable substrates. During my doctoral degree program, I also received my MSE degree in Robotics in 2024 from the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/). 

Prior to this, I received my MSE degree in Electrical Engineering from the Department of [Electrical and Systems Engineering](https://www.ese.upenn.edu/) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in 2019. During my time here, I worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant in [Kod*Lab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/) under Prof. [Daniel E. Koditschek](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/kod/). During my time here, I investigated the behavior and dynamics of legged robot during obstacle interaction. I received my B.Tech degree in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering-for-ug-courses) from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/), Vellore, India in 2017.     

I have published in [IEEE RA-L](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l) (presented at ICRA 2020) and presented at [ICRA 2022](https://www.ieee-ras.org/component/rseventspro/event/2095-icra-2022). 2 journal preprints are currently under development from my Ph.D. work. I also have a total of 11 conference abstracts that were presented in conferences. I have been shortlisted (8 finalists out of 210 talks selected) for the [Best Student Paper finalist (Division of Comparative Biomechanics)](https://sicb.burkclients.com/wp/?page_id=2124) at the SICB Annual Meeting in 2023. I have also received a Mechanical Engineering Departmental Fellowship for the academic year 2019-2020 during my Ph.D.

I have mentored total of 32 students at Terradynamics Lab (31 students) and Kod*Lab (1 student) including 1 PhD student, 14 masterâ€™s students, 10 undergraduate students, and 7 high school students in animal studies, bioinspired robot design and prototyping, and tools and methods development. 

I have taken up leader roles
