excerpt: "About me"
---

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the [Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am a member of [Lauder Lab](https://sites.harvard.edu/glauder/) which is led by Prof. [George V. Lauder](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/george-v-lauder). 

I am pursuing research in animal locomotion and bio-inspired robotics. I have experience in systematic study of animal and robot locomotion, developing tools and methods, building robots and sensors, and reinforcement learning techniques.

I pursued my Ph.D. degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.jhu.edu/) from 2019 to 2024 under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Li](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/chen-li/) at [Terradynamics Lab](https://li.me.jhu.edu/) from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research focused on studying and understanding animal and robot locomotion on 3-D complex terrain and wet flowable substrates. During my doctoral degree program, I also received my MSE degree in Robotics in 2024 from the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/). Prior to this, I received my MSE degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) in 2019. During my time here, I worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant in [Kod*Lab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/) under Prof. [Daniel E. Koditschek](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/kod/). I received my B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [VIT University](https://vit.ac.in/), Vellore, India in 2017.
