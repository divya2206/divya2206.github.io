# Doctoral Research

## Amphibious fish locomotion on mud with various strengths:
• Designed and conducted animal experiments with three model organisms to study three distinct strategies seen in amphibious fishes
moving on mud with varying mud strength.
• Developed tools and methods to characterize and control the mud strength during the study.
• Performed systematic study on the performance of mudskipper using appendicular locomotion and mode transitions on different mud
strengths.
• Performed preliminary study on the performance of bichir using axial appendicular locomotion and ropefish using axial locomotion
on different mud strengths.
• Currently studying lifting in amphibious fishes using a robophysical model on different mud strengths.

## Sensorized snake robot to understand snake locomotion on complex 3D environment:
• Built a sensorized snake robot, SenSnake, to study how snakes use terrain-body contact forces to traverse a complex 3D environment.
• Explored a model-based calibration considering the viscoelastic behavior of the piezoresistive sensor, which will be useful for future
studies.
• Developed a force estimation model using the model-based calibration to estimate forces based on sensor input.

# Master's Research
• Investigated the behavior and dynamics of legged robot during obstacle interaction under the guidance of Prof. Daniel E. Koditschek as part of master’s thesis
• The objective is to model the complex non-linear behavior of robot-obstacle interaction into a simple linear system
• Programmed the HQRHEX robot using C++ that allowed the robot to move with different gaits and stride frequency using a controller
• Created an algorithm to automatically generate the optimum window of data where the robot enters the equilibrium state and stays there till the end of the periodic obstacles
• Built a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the robot-obstacle interaction using the experiment results
• Developed an algorithm to identify contact points between the obstacle and the legs, and on flat ground to help understand the change in contact point pattern when the robot shows different behaviors during the obstacle traversal.
